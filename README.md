# webdev
I have started on a webdev journey to get more experience in the different realms of programming. I am using The Odin Project as a guide for this path and I will push to this repo once in a while when I have decent progress.

If you see this repo and have any comments or suggestions for me, feel free to let me know, I love learning different ways to do things and I will take any and all criticisms.
