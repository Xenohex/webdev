            Links are made using anchor elements: <a></a> 
            They don't do anything unless they are given an attribute.
            href is the hyperlink reference attribute that tells the anchor
                where we want to the link to go to.

        <p>
            There are two kinds of links, <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>relative</strong>>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Absolute links are usually used for links to external websites, 
            Relative links are always used for internal webpages in the parent website.
        </p>
        Absolute links are made up of the following parts:
        <ul>
            protocol://domain/path
        </ul>

        <!-- Images can be displayed with the <img> element, which is self-closing -->
        <p>
            Images can be displayed with either absolute or relative paths just like links.
        </p>
        <!-- Every image should also have an alt attribute to describe it. -->
