vim <filename> opens an existing file for editing
    or creates a new one if it does not already exist

Vim has three modes:
    normal - default for navigation and "simple editing"
    insert - for inserting and modifying text
    command line - for operations (saving, exiting,..)

Keybinds (in normal mode):
    Esc - always switches to normal mode
    : - pressing the colon switches vim to command line mode
    i - switches to insert mode
    $ - takes you to the end of the current line
    dd - deletes the current line and moves everything up
    u - undo
    v - highlight mode to select text (use arrows)
    y - (yank) copy
    p - paste
    o - make a new line beneath the current line
        this also puts you into insert mode
    n - next (when searching)
    ww (hold ctrl) - switches between split vim editors
    


Commands:
    :q - quits. will warn if the file wasn't saved
        :q! quits without saving
    :x / :wg - saves and quits
        :w will write but warns if overwrite
    :set number - turns on line numbers on the left
    :<line number> - jumps you to the line number you choose
    :$ - takes you to the end of a file
    :/<search_keyword> - text string to search for
        press 'n' in normal mode to comb through the findings
    :split <filename> - opens a second vim editor in the same terminal
        for maximum productivity i guess
        ww (hold ctrl) - switches between the split vims (in normal mode)
    :vsplit <filename> does the same thing as split but splits them vertically
